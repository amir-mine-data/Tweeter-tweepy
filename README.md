# Tweeter-tweepy
#In this project I used Tweepy to conduct a historical and live stream search of Twitter.
The code was written in PyCharm and tested on Windows 10.
In order to use the code, you have to register on Twitter developer (https://developer.twitter.com/) website and get your
consumer key and tokens and add to the code.
The required libraries need to be imported.
